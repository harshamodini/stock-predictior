# Stock Market Prediction with Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This Python project is designed to predict stock market data using machine learning and deep learning models. It aims to provide insights into the future performance of stocks, enabling investors and traders to make informed decisions. The project incorporates various machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to predict stock prices.

## Project Overview

Stock market prediction is a challenging and complex task due to the myriad of factors that influence market behavior. This project leverages historical stock price data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis to create predictive models. It combines both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning approaches, allowing users to explore the performance of different techniques.
